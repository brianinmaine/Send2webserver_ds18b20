# Send2webserver_ds18b20
I got this code from all over the net, if it's yours, email me and I'll make sure to give you credit! +Thanks to you!

Use ds18b20 temp sensor connected to Wemos mini to send and log temp to Apache/PHP/MySql on linux.

First real project, very simple temperature sensor that displays the temp on a SSD1306 display and then connects and uploads the temp every 5 minutes to my LAMP webserver running on Ubuntu (17.10) linux. I included the sql file to make it easier. I also found code to allow me to have multiple access points. 

It seems like this would be a simple way to log any sensor(s).

I bought stuff from aliexpress.com, did have to wait a month for all the stuff.
wemos mini ~ $2.50
ds18b20 waterproof temp probe ~ $1.00
ssd1306 display ~ $2.50
wemos mini proto shield ~ 5/$3.00
old cell phone charger for power ~ free :)
Total cost about $7. I didn't put it in a box or anything, it just hangs in my barn.
